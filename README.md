Diwali Sales Analysis

🔍 Excited to share my recent project: "Data Analysis Using Python"! 📈💻 I delved into the world of data with Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to extract valuable insights from a dataset. Here's a glimpse into my process:

🔹 Installation and Setup: I started by installing essential libraries using pip, including numpy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib, setting the stage for efficient data manipulation and visualization.

🔹 Data Cleaning: After importing the Diwali sales dataset, I rolled up my sleeves for data cleaning. From dropping irrelevant columns to transforming data types, I ensured the dataset was primed for analysis.

🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Armed with seaborn and matplotlib, I delved into exploratory data analysis. From insightful bar charts to revealing count plots, I uncovered fascinating patterns and trends within the data.

💡 Key Insights: Here are some standout findings:

🚺 Female buyers dominated, with 7832 buyers, surpassing male buyers by 3407, in purchasing power.
👩‍💼 The 26-35 age group, particularly females, showed the highest engagement, with 3269 female buyers and 1272 male buyers.
🌏 Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka emerged as hotspots for sales, with significant orders and total sales.
💍 Married women emerged as significant spenders, with 6518 purchases compared to 4721 from other marital status groups.
💼 IT, Healthcare, and Aviation topped the charts for common occupations among buyers, with 1583, 1408, and 1320 purchases respectively.
🍽️ Food, Clothing, and Electronics stole the show as the most popular product categories, with 2490, 2655, and 2087 purchases respectively.
📊 Conclusion: These insights pave the way for informed business strategies. Targeting married women aged 26-35, especially in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors, and focusing on popular product categories could drive substantial sales growth.

📚 Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

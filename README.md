Diwali Sales Analysis

🔍 Excited to share my recent project: "Data Analysis Using Python"! 📈💻 I delved into the world of data with Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to extract valuable insights from a dataset. Here's a glimpse into my process:

🔹 Installation and Setup: I started by installing essential libraries using pip, including numpy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib, setting the stage for efficient data manipulation and visualization.

🔹 Data Cleaning: After importing the Diwali sales dataset, I rolled up my sleeves for data cleaning. From dropping irrelevant columns to transforming data types, I ensured the dataset was primed for analysis.

🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Armed with seaborn and matplotlib, I delved into exploratory data analysis. From insightful bar charts to revealing count plots, I uncovered fascinating patterns and trends within the data.
